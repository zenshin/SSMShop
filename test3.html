        <p>Customer is required to make an upfront deposit 20% to commence production and serves as a guarantee for the supplier
            since orders are custom-made to individual specification.</p>
        <p>To enable the Supplier to perform the contractual terms and produce a high quality suit garment, the Customer must
            co-operate with the supplier by providing the supplier with their exact measurements/ dimensions.</p>
        <p>The Supplier offers a professional tailoring service, therefore, if the information relating to the requested size
            of the garment proves to be erroneous</p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p>If the Customer changes or wants to cancel or alter the size of the garment after placing the order, the following
            shall occur:</p>
        <p>The Supplier will not be liable for any additional expenses incurred in altering the garment.</p>
        <p>The Customer must arrange for receipt or collection and or fitting of the garment within a reasonable time. Where
            a reasonable time is deemed to be within two months of the date of being ready for collection as per the ready
            for collection system email sent and as recorded on the Supplier system. After such time, the supplier reserves
            the right to destroy or dispose of the garment in question. If the Customer agrees with the Supplier to collect

        <h2>RISK OF LOSS</h2>

        <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ORDER PLACEMENT, ORDER CHANGES, FIT GUARANTEE AND RETURNS
        </h2>
        <p>Use of this website implies that all the terms and conditions in regards to orders placed, order placement and other
            issues concerning orders, as outlined here have been accepted and agreed to.</p>
        <p>It is understood that an order, once it has been submitted and subsequently processed, cannot be cancelled upon commencement
            of the manufacturing process. Where the order consists of multiple garments, the start of the manufacturing process
            commences with the first suit; for the avoidance of doubt, subsequent garments on a multiple garment order cannot
            be cancelled once the first garment has been started. Should it under some circumstances, be agreed by the Supplier
            to cancel an order, cancellation charges of £50/€70, together with any outstanding charges for costs incurred
            by the supplier, would be deducted from the submitted payment before a refund is issued.</p>
        <p>Any changes must be made to an order within 24 hours of placing the order; making a change within 24 hours of placing
            the order does not guarantee that a change can be made. The Supplier will, where possible, endeavour to make
            changes. All changes to an order, once the order has been processed and where a change remains possible, will
            carry a £20/€35 change fee per change which is in addition to the difference in any charges associated with that
            change, be it changes to colours, fabrics, styles, sizes or any other aspect.</p>
        <p>As each order is personally tailored, the Supplier is unable to resell an order to any Customer other than the Customer
            placing the order, and as such the Supplier cannot accept returns on the basis of a change of heart on the part
            of the Customer. Neither can the Supplier accept returns where the Customer requests a change to an existing
            order and the Supplier cannot fulfill that change. Where there is a dispute between Customer and Supplier over
            the styling of the order, the record on the Supplier's ordering system is taken as the firm and final order.</p>
        <p>All customers who are measured by Suitsurmesur receive a fit guarantee and fittings with the completed garment for
            minor (trouser hem, shirt cuffs) tweaks that are required. The fit guarantee entitles alterations to an order
            up to 2 months after time of collection. Any alterations desired after 2 months from time of collection will
            carry alterations fees. Customers measuring themselves online may purchase a retrospective fit guarantee where
            required for £40/€55 up to 2 months after taking delivery of their order. The retrospective fit guarantee operates
            in the same manner as the fit guarantee when customer is measured by Suitsurmesur.</p>
        <p>All customers choosing to use their own fabric for their garments made by the Supplier are obliged to, on demand
            and where necessary, procure a second quantity of cloth in the event of a replacement. The Supplier retains ultimate
            discretion on whether a product is deemed faulty or not and whether the cost of the second quantity of cloth
            is payable by the Supplier or the Customer. The Supplier will not be held liable for any losses incurred as a
            result of the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of any order placed using cloth not stocked by the supplier.</p>
        <p>In the unlikely event that a manufacturing error has occurred, Suitsurmesur will follow our strict repair, replace
            or refund policy up to 1 year after completion of an order. We will require you return the garment to us, either
            to one of our branches or by post for inspection. We are not liable for defects resulting from the customer not
            following our care instructions. Should a customer return a garment over one year after completion Suitsurmesur
            will not accept responsibility for a faulty garment and will maintain the customer has had fair use of the product.</p>
        <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF DEADLINES AND DELIVERIES</h2>
        <p>It is understood that turnaround and dispatch of the orders placed at the Supplier may vary from time to time depending
            on current order volumes, work schedules, fabric availability or a particular characteristic of the order placed.
            The Supplier will try its best to comply with the standard turnaround time of 6-8 weeks. An expedited manufacture
            option can be purchased for £50 offering an estimated 3-week delivery before garment(s) final production.</p>
        <p>While turnaround of an order is indicated as an estimated dispatch date in the “My orders and profiles” section of
            the Supplier’s website, it is understood that the supplier will try to keep as close to the scheduled estimated
            dispatch date as possible. Dispatch times may vary according to availability, any guarantees or representations
            made as to delivery times are limited to mainland UK and subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or
            force majeure (including Acts of God, Acts of War or Acts of Terrorism) for which we will not be responsible.
            The supplier will not be responsible for such delays resulting from situations within the recipient's control,
            such as recipient not being available to accept delivery, or incorrect delivery details supplied. A delay does
            not include any alterations that are requested by the Customer.</p>
        <p>Suitsurmesur can change these terms and conditions at any time. For more information please contact us at info@suitsurmesur.com</p>
