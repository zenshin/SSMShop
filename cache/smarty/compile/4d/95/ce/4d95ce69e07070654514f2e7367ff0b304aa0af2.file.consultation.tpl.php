            <hr>
            <p>This is the basis of how our private consultant can guide you in your decision making process. We start the consultation
                process by engaging our clients through friendly chats what they are looking for, what styles they like and
                for what occasion their potential commission is for. A suit for the office and a suit for a gala are two
                very different entities. Therefore, before you meet our private consultant, know the suit’s purpose, it’s
                essential!

            <h2>WHAT STYLE OF SUIT DO YOU PREFER</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>It’s important to have done a little research here, so have a think about what it is you like, a single or double
                breasted? Have you thought about the personal touches you want inside of your suit? Is there a certain colour
                or pattern you’re drawn to? To get what you really want, it can sometimes help to bring along inspirational
                images of styles or particular fabrics you like, although this is not vital. You can also look at our gallery
                here to draw inspiration. This will help our consultant shape a piece that is distinctive and truly you.
                We can go over the various options and prices for our custom orders at this stage with you if you so wish.
                There is no obligation to work with us if you feel our services don’t meet your expectations. Regardless,
                we are always delighted to help anyone, reach the best option for them.

            <p>Different processes and details take different amounts of time so if you need this suit urgently, our consultant
                informs you of your options. If this is for example, your wedding suit, our consultant will work to a date,
                but would also like to know that there is time to create your suit twice over. The more ample time you have,
                the more refined your suit can be, offering several consultations if needs be. The consultation process should
                be one of delight, as you and our consultant work together to craft something of true beauty, something you

            <h3>Why Custom Made Suit</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>We take pride in the fact that a remarkable wardrobe with a personal touch should be within reach to all men
                without exception. Our objective is simple: to afford people the luxury to assert their uniqueness by selecting
                their own style, display their personality through their clothing by personalising everything from choice
                of fabric selection, to the buttons, pocket styling, fabric lining and lapel type. We strive to create an
                atmosphere where quality meets customer satisfaction. Above all, the principal benefit of custom made clothing
                is that it fits the individual like a glove and once a suit has a perfect fit and drape, it totally eliminates
                the need for conspicuous alterations.

            <h3>Why Custom Made Shirts</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>All our custom shirts are made to the exacting standards set by Jermyn Street, the heart of British shirt making.
                Our custom shirts start with the two c’s: collar & cuff. We have a choice of eight collars and eight cuffs
                from which to choose from, each catering to every gentleman’s personalised style & taste. Every shirt is
                made to your design and measurements – the client has a choice of silhouette, fit, collars and cuffs, whether
                to have a pocket, extent of collar stiffness and with or without bones. The option to have plackets, buttons
                (white mother of pearl or smoked shell), your own initials monogrammed on the cuffs, chest, in fact a choice
                of nine monogrammed positions is available to you. Our team will work closely with you to pick an existing
                pattern for your shirt’s fabric. Expect the finest cottons, twill and poplins from reputable mills such as
                Thomas Mason, Canclini and Loro Piana with a choice of 400 – 800 cloths. Your upper body is then measured
                ensuring your consultant creates a fit that is adapted to your body as best as possible. The lead time for
                our custom shirts is 3-4 weeks. Express service is available at an extra cost.

        <h2>FABRIC - MATERIAL CHOICE</h2>

        <h3>IT ALL BEGINS WITH A FINE CLOTH</h3>
        <p>Custom suiting is truly an art form. Like any veritable work of art, it requires the finest materials – in this situation,
            it’s the fabric used in creating your suit. The quality of the fabric greatly enhances and influences the way
            it handles; and performance of your suit – from its cut, to its drape, to its breathability, to its resistance
            to wrinkles and durability.

            <p>At SUITSURMESUR®, we source only the world’s finest fabrics from the world’s best mills, sourcing a majority
                of our fabrics from the English and Italian regions. The outcome: strong, superior fabrics in a variety of
                patterns and colours with timeless finishes. It’s vital to take a close range look and have a physical feel
                of the various fabrics as photos on the internet can give off a wrong impression of fabrics for colour distortion,
                texture or feel. We recommend that you take control of everything from fabric selection, suit body lining,
                construction type to personalisation of your potential suit.

                so that our team can advice and help you through with suitable options. Please feel free to leave us a note
                in your appointment request or let us know over the phone whatever suit(s) options you want and we shall
