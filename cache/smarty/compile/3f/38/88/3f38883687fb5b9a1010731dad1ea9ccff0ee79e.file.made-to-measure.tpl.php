            The tailor’s natural dexterity and artisanal craftsmanship is one of the most advanced guild of vocations of our society.
            We are delighted to be able to offer the retained legacy within the SUITSURMESUR Made to Measure collection by
            creating unique custom pieces for every occasion sans exception. Our custom offering neatly bridges the gap of
            high street ready to wear and offers the client a quick and efficient way to have a suit made to his own specifications.
            From corporate suits to casual clothing items, we strive to work closely with our clients to design masterpieces
            that mirror their image with a twist that draws inspiration from our cultural heritage yet giving every SUITSURMESUR
            creations a chic and unique exotic appeal. Our suits are tailored using many of the traditional Savile Row methods
            usually associated with bespoke suits and take about 6 to 7 weeks to make.

            </br>Our exclusive Made to Measure choice is for the quintessential gentleman looking for tailored luxury suits,
            selected from a wide range of hand-selected opulent fabrics and created for the client’s personal expression
            of sartorial excellence. Our suits are made from an existing pattern that can be adapted to fit the shape of
            your body and has been developed to create a flattering appearance, whilst still adhering to Savile Row Made
            to Measure standard. They are also half or fully canvassed making for a sharper and cleaner drape along your
            body contours and on the entirety of your two or three piece, particularly good for super-lightweight cloths.

            </br>You can choose all details such as internal trimmings, traditional fabric linings and our personalised in
            house exotic linings, buttons, pockets and you can also tweak your suit to fit your individual style with ease.
