        <h2>CONSTRUCTION</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The character of a properly tailored suit is determined and achieved by three elements, fabric, construction and
            fit. This is what is needed to master the true art of proper suit making. Suitsurmesur explores the wonder and
            beauty of suit construction in detail. This forms the core of the overall quality and this process is the basis
            for ensuring both durability and fit. Suitsurmesur provides fully canvassed, half- canvassed and unstructured
            suit construction methods. A considerable amount of time and steps go into the creation of a SUITSURMESUR suit,
            which results in a meticulous finish.

            <h2>THE FULL CANVAS SUIT</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Fully canvassed as the name conveys is quite simply a suit of sheer quality. Traditionally, this type of suit
                is constructed with a layer of horsehair canvas under a wool fabric carapace. This gracefully made canvas
                holds the shape of the suit and amongst others keeps it from sagging or losing its shape. Consider it as
                the essence of your suit combination. This hardwearing canvas is then cut to the jacket’s form and the wool
                is seamed to it. Over the course of wearing the jacket, this resilient canvas allows the suit fabric to shape
                to your body gradually molding a flawless fit. Long lifespan is achieved through rubbing tension at friction
                points, i.e. shoulders, elbows, allowing your suit breathability space and the ability to circulate flexibly
                and freely. A chest canvas serves the following purposes:
                <ul class="aom-ul">
                    <li>It provides physical weight to the jacket </li>
                    <li> It allows a tailor to manipulate the roll of the lapels</li>
                    <li> It keeps the chest plate clean with no sagging, bubbling or wrinkling. This is what makes a sit so powerful
                        and flattering on a man, the clean, shaped chest lines.</li>
                    <li>It molds to the shape of the wearer’s chest over time. The heat of your body will eventually mold the
                        shape of the canvas, making the garment fit you better and better over time.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>THE HALF CANVAS SUIT</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>As the name indicates, half canvas suits have canvas material running across the chest and lapel of the jacket
                only. Past that, the rest of the jacket is fused. This should not be a deterrent factor. This usually brings
                along a lower cost of fabrication than a fully canvassed suit option and far less complications that you
                may find inherent in a fused suit adding to its longevity. The half canvassing ensures structure in the upper
                layer of the jacket providing for a natural drape running across the chest as opposed to looking stiff and
                lifeless much like many fused jackets do.

            <h2>THE UNSTRUCTURED SUIT / JACKET</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                While standard structured blazers could be described as the clean cut, straight-laced analyst of menswear, their unstructured
                counterparts serve another purpose. The biggest difference between structured and unstructured blazers is
                their shape and drape. An unstructured suit holds less shape and is not cut quite as precise to the body.
                The padding, inner workings and linings usually inherent in structured jackets are removed to give the suit
                a far softer and relaxed fit. Unstructured suit jacket will symmetrically follow the shoulder more closely,
                which ensures the jacket drapes naturally to the body in a more relaxed way (especially in comparison to
                the constructed drape of the structured jacket). Common additional features such as pockets, working cuffs
                and exposed seams also help to emphasise a casual aesthetic and they are often made of only a single layer
                of material, such as canvas, cotton, linen or lightweight wools. A quality unstructured suit jacket should
                still have some chest canvas. It should just be made from a thinner, lighter and more flexible material.
                From a subjective point, an unstructured jacket should be half-canvassed rather than a full canvas in order
                to make the overall garment lighter and more flexible. The advantages of an unstructured suit jacket are
                as follow:
                <ul ul class="aom-ul">
                    <li>The garment is lighter in physical weight, less restricting and more comfortable due to greater range
                        of motion.
                    </li>
                    <li>The garment breathes better, unlocking the ability of natural fabrics to breathe and regulate body temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>The garment is more versatile; the suit is easier to pair with casual attire and the jacket can double
                        as a sport coat.
                    </li>
                    <li>The garment has a more natural silhouette, creates less of a “strictly corporate” sensibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>The garment is easier and cheaper for tailors to alter; they don’t need to remove and re-attach the lining
                        to access seams.
                    </li>
                    <li>The garment is easier to fold and pack for traveling.
                    </li>
                    <li>The garment can be cut slimmer, which can be more flattering for slim-fit wearers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
