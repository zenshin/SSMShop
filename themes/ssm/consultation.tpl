            <h2>WHEN AND WHERE WILL YOU BE WEARING THIS SUIT</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>This is the basis of how our private consultant can guide you in your decision making process. We start the consultation
                process by engaging our clients through friendly chats what they are looking for, what styles they like and
                for what occasion their potential commission is for. A suit for the office and a suit for a gala are two
                very different entities.
            </p>
            <p>For instance, a business suit does not have to be like a traditional office uniforms in grey & navy. For a business look, you might opt for a much less conservative look in a creative business (<a href="/creations">refer to our suit creations for inspiration</a>). With so many ways to distinguish yourself from the crowd, you can add character to your personality by adding bold textures to your ensemble without compromising your overall professionalism or giving off the wrong appearance for your business environment. Corporate environments such as banking and legal call for a more formal choice that enhances your role but also reflects your personal style.<br>
        Therefore, before you meet our private consultant, know the suit’s purpose, it’s essential!</p>

            <h2>WHAT STYLE OF SUIT DO YOU PREFER</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>It’s important to have done a little research here, so have a think about what it is you like, a single or double
                breasted? Have you thought about the personal touches you want inside of your suit? Is there a certain colour
                or pattern you’re drawn to? To get what you really want, it can sometimes help to bring along inspirational
                image of styles or particular fabrics you like, although this is not vital. You can also look at our <a href="/gallery">galleries</a>
                here to draw inspiration. This will help our consultant shape a piece that is distinctive and truly you.
                We can go over the various options and prices for our custom orders at this stage with you if you so wish.
                There is no obligation to work with us if you feel our services don’t meet your expectations. Regardless,
                we are always delighted to help anyone, reach the best option for them.

            <hr>
            <p>Different processes and details take different amounts of time so if you need this suit urgently, our consultant
                informs you of your options. If this is for example, your wedding suit, our consultant will work to a date,
                but would also like to know that there is time to create your suit twice over. The more ample time you have,
                the more refined your suit can be, offering several consultations if needs be. The consultation process should

            <h3>Why Custom Made Suit</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>We take pride in the fact that a remarkable wardrobe with a personal touch should be within reach to all men
                without exception. Our objective is simple: to afford people the luxury to assert their uniqueness by selecting
                their own style, display their personality through their clothing by personalising everything from choice
                of fabric selection, to the buttons, pocket styling, fabric lining and lapel type. We strive to create an
                atmosphere where quality meets customer satisfaction. Above all, the principal benefit of custom made clothing
                is that it fits the individual like a glove and once a suit has a perfect fit and drape, it totally eliminates
                the need for conspicuous alterations.

            <h3>Hand Finishing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Finishing is one of the key assets of our custom suits. With a beautifully elevated lapel buttonhole (rather than a flatter machine stitched one) and soft hand stitching on the jacket buttonhole, armhole, hem, edges, welts, flaps, your suit will clearly stand out from the crowd. These more than anything are synonymous with our attention to detail the more obvious luxury features that earns our custom made suits their stripes.

            <h3>Why Custom Made Shirts</h3>

        <h2>FABRIC - MATERIAL CHOICE</h2>

        <h3>IT ALL BEGINS WITH A FINE CLOTH</h3>
        <p>Custom suiting is truly an art form. Like any veritable work of art, it requires the finest materials – in this situation,
            it’s the fabric used in creating your suit. The quality of the fabric greatly enhances and influences the way
            it handles; and performance of your suit – from its cut, to its drape, to its breathability, to its resistance
            to wrinkles and durability. In essence, the finer the cloth, the more durable it will be, with the added advantage of holding their shape so that you look as well turned out on the journey home as you did on the way in.

            <p>At SUITSURMESUR®, we source only the world’s finest fabrics from the world’s best mills, sourcing a majority
                of our fabrics from the English and Italian regions. The outcome: strong, superior fabrics in a variety of
                patterns and colours with timeless finishes. It’s vital to take a close range look and have a physical feel
                of the various fabrics as photos on the internet can give off a wrong impression of fabrics for colour distortion,
                texture or feel. We recommend that you take control of everything from fabric selection, suit body lining,
                construction type to personalisation of your potential suit.
