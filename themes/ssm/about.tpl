            <h2>HISTORY - HERITAGE</h2>
            <p>SUITSURMESUR is a London | Paris Made to Measure label specialising in luxury couture for the contemporary man
                of exquisite taste. The brand was created by <span class="dike">Monsieur Dike</span> to bring its unique
                custom suiting philosophy to a new generation of well dressed masses blending traditional tailoring with
                modern style. Our aesthetic roots are simultaneously in modern tailoring, extracted and inspired by
                a concept that draws inspiration from our African Heritage. In a market where a suit body lining is traditionally
                homogenous and monopolised by western designs, we work hard to demonstrate to the world that African arts
                and prints can be put to good use cross culture especially in the construction of a corporate suit. Our philosophy is to create unequivocal luxury pieces of unsurpassable quality, but to push the boundaries
                through creative design, colour and cut. This legacy of strong cultural identity has been emphasised on extensively
                in the creation of SUITSURMESUR Made to Measure menswear collection and Made in England handcrafted accessories.</p>

                prints in our fabric linings with each piece having a backstory. Our garments symbolise imagination, creativity
                and the link between different forms of art and culture.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE US</h3>
            <p>In the corporate world, a lot of people wear suits that are tailored in the same spirit, often too traditional
                yet lacking the exotic appeal, soul or character that embraces our social diversity. The concept was born
                out of the need to allow style conscious individuals the opportunity to assert their uniqueness yet creating
                high quality masterpieces that fit all body curvature and natural posture sans exception.</p>

            <hr />
            <h3>ARTISANAL APPROACH & NATURAL ABILITIES ARE STILL WITHIN OUR CONFINES</h3>
            <p>The personalised cutting of fabric, stitching, sewing and skills are all natural requisite aptitude employed
                in the creation of a Made to Measure tailored suit. These skills that were once acquired over many years
                through diligent apprenticeship are slowly falling into decline due in part to an ever-evolving industrialised
                society. </p><p>Fortunately this artisanal approach and natural abilities are still within our confines,
                something that mass production settings can never emulate, whether in terms of construction, quality or character
                and allow each of our Made to Measure suit to have and benefit from a personalised unique soft touch.</p>

            <h2>FOUNDER & CREATIVE DIRECTOR</h2>
            <hr />
            <h3>STORY TELLING IS IMPORTANT TO US</h3>
            <p>Jean Louis O. DIKE (<span class="dike">Monsieur Dike</span> ) graduated with a distinction in Commercial & International
                Law (Masters of Laws), Financial Services Law Specialist but could not resist pursuing his long time passion
                for quality tailored suits. He spent considerable amount of time developing a personal style, learning about classic men’s wear on style conscious platforms, studying the dynamics of custom clothing and its emotional connections to men. He drew motivation to create special from purchasing off the rack suits proposing
                little to no design & body lining choices that embrace our social diversity. In a market where a suit body lining is traditionally homogenous and monopolised by western designs, he saw a need to create his own custom made suit label and Made in England handcrafted accessories with a design that draws inspiration from his multi-cultural (African & European) heritage.
                With the novel suiting philosophy in operation, <span class="dike">Monsieur Dike</span> offers a custom craftsmanship
                that delivers good fit, great quality and achieves almost the similar level of precise tailoring and attention
                to detail as Savile Row Bespoke yet reasonably priced to reflect uniqueness.</p>
