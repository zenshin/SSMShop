            <h4>HISTORY | HERITAGE</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>SUITSURMESUR® is a London | Paris Made To Measure label specialising in luxury couture for the contemporary man
                of exquisite taste. The brand was created by <span class="dike">Monsieur Dike</span> to bring its unique
                custom suiting philosophy to a new generation of well dressed masses blending traditional tailoring with
                modern style. Our aesthetic roots are simultaneously in modern tailoring, extracted and inspired by a concept that draws inspiration
                from our African Heritage. In a market where a suit body lining is traditionally homogenous and monopolised
                by western designs, we work hard to demonstrate to the world that African arts and prints can be put to good
                use cross culture especially in the construction of a corporate suit. This legacy of strong cultural identity has been emphasised on extensively in the creation of SUITSURMESUR® Made
                To Measure collection.</p>

            <h4>WE ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW THAT OUR CONCEPT CAN BE NO LESS INTERESTING OR BEAUTIFUL</h4>

                prints in our fabric linings with each piece having a backstory. Our garments symbolise imagination, creativity
                and the link between different forms of art and culture.</p>

            <hr />
            <h4>SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE US</h4>

            <p>In the corporate world, a lot of people wear suits that are tailored in the same spirit, often too traditional
                yet lacking the exotic appeal, soul or character that embraces our social diversity. The concept was born
                out of the need to allow style conscious individuals the opportunity to assert their uniqueness yet creating
                high quality masterpieces that fit all body curvature and natural posture sans exception.</p>

            <h4>ETHICS</h4>
            <hr />
            <h4>ARTISANAL APPROACH & NATURAL ABILITIES ARE STILL WITHIN OUR CONFINES</h4>

            <p>The personalised cutting of fabric, stitching, sewing and skills are all natural requisite aptitude employed
                in the creation of a Made To Measure tailored suit. These skills that were once acquired over many years
                through diligent apprenticeship are slowly falling into decline due in part to an ever-evolving industrialised
                society.
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately this artisanal approach and natural abilities are still within our confines, something that mass
                production settings can never emulate, whether in terms of construction, quality or character and allow each
                of our Made To Measure suit to have and benefit from a personalised unique soft touch.</p>

            <h4>FOUNDER & CREATIVE DIRECTOR</h4>
            <hr />
            <h4>STORY TELLING IS IMPORTANT TO US</h4>

            <p>Jean Louis O. DIKE (<span class="dike">Monsieur Dike</span> ) graduated with a distinction in Commercial & International
                Law (Masters of Laws), Financial Services Law Specialist but could not resist pursuing his long time passion
                for quality tailored suits. He drew motivation to create special to create special from purchasing off the rack suits proposing little to no
                design & body lining choices that embrace our social diversity. In a market where a suit body lining is traditionally homogenous and monopolised by western designs, he saw a
                need to create his own Custom Made suit label with a design that draws inspiration from his multi-cultural
                (African & European) heritage. With the novel suiting philosophy in operation, <span class="dike">Monsieur Dike</span>  offers a custom craftsmanship that delivers good
                fit, great quality and achieves almost the similar level of precise tailoring and attention to detail as
                Savile Row Bespoke yet reasonably priced to reflect uniqueness.</p>
