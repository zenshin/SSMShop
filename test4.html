            to commence production and serves as a guarantee for the supplier since orders are custom made to individual

            and the balance prior to release of production ready garments(s).</p>
        <p>To enable the supplier to perform the contractual terms and produce a high quality product, the customer must co-operate
            with the supplier by agreeing to the exact measurement taken during the course of measurement.</p>

            of the product proves to be erroneous</p>
        <p>OR</p>

        <p>The customer must arrange for receipt or collection and or fitting of the product within a reasonable time. Where
            a reasonable time is deemed to be within two months of the date of being ready for collection as per the ready
            for collection system email sent and as recorded on the supplier system. After such time, the supplier reserves
            the right to destroy or dispose of the product in question. If the customer agrees with the supplier to collect
            the product outside the reasonable time mentioned previously, the supplier shall not be liable for any loss relating

        <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ORDER PLACEMENT, ORDER CHANGES, FIT GUARANTEE AND RETURNS

        </h2>
        <p>Use of this website implies that all the terms and conditions in regards to orders placed, order placement and other
            issues concerning orders, as outlined here have been accepted and agreed to.</p>
        <p>It is understood that an order, once it has been submitted and subsequently processed, cannot be cancelled upon commencement
            of the manufacturing process. Where the order consists of multiple garments, the start of the manufacturing process
            commences with the first product; for the avoidance of doubt, subsequent products on a multiple product order
            cannot be cancelled once the first product has been started. Should it under some circumstances, be agreed by
            the supplier to cancel an order, cancellation charges of (amount to be determined by the size of order), together
            with any outstanding charges for costs incurred by the supplier, would be deducted from the submitted payment
            before a refund is issued.</p>
        <p>Any changes must be made to an order within 24 hours of placing the order; making a change within 24 hours of placing
            the order does not guarantee that a change can be made. The supplier will, where possible, endeavour to make
            changes. All changes to an order, once the order has been processed and where a change remains possible, will
            carry a (amount to be determined by garment type) fee per change which is in addition to the difference in any
            charges associated with that change, be it changes to colours, fabrics, styles, sizes or any other aspect. </p>
        <p>As each order is personally tailored, the supplier is unable to resell an order to any customer other than the customer
            placing the order, and as such the supplier cannot accept returns on the basis of a change of heart on the part
            of the customer. Neither can the supplier accept returns where the customer requests a change to an existing
            order and the supplier cannot fulfill that change. Where there is a dispute between customer and supplier over
            the styling of the order, the record on the supplier's ordering system is taken as the firm and final order.</p>
        <p>All customers who are measured by SUITSURMESUR will receive a fit guarantee and fittings with the completed product
            for minor (trouser hem, shirt cuffs) tweaks that are required. The fit guarantee entitles alterations to an order
            up to 2 months after time of collection. Any alterations desired after 2 months from time of collection will
            carry alterations fees. </p>
        <p>All customers choosing to use their own fabric for their garments made by the supplier are obliged to, on demand
            and where necessary, procure a second quantity of cloth in the event of a replacement. The supplier retains ultimate
            discretion on whether a product is deemed faulty or not and whether the cost of the second quantity of cloth
            is payable by the supplier or the customer. The supplier will not be held liable for any losses incurred as a
            result of the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of any order placed using cloth not stocked by the supplier. </p>
        <p>In the unlikely event that a manufacturing error has occurred, SUITSURMESUR will follow our strict repair, replace
            or refund policy up to 1 year after completion of an order. We will require you return the product to us, either
            to our business operation premises or by post for inspection. We are not liable for defects resulting from the
            customer not following our care instructions. Should a customer return a garment over one year after completion,
            SUITSURMESUR will not accept responsibility for a faulty product and will maintain the customer has had fair
            use of the product. </p>

        <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF DEADLINES AND DELIVERIES</h2>
        <p>It is understood that turnaround and dispatch of the orders placed at the supplier may vary from time to time depending
            on current order volumes, work schedules, fabric availability or a particular characteristic of the order placed.
            The supplier will try its best to comply with the standard turnaround time of 6-8 weeks. An expedited manufacture
            option can be purchased for (amount to be determined) offering an estimated 3-week delivery before product(s)
            final production.</p>
        <p>While turnaround of an order is indicated as an estimated dispatch date in the “Profile Account” section of the supplier’s
            website, it is understood that the supplier will try to keep as close to the scheduled estimated dispatch date
            as possible. Dispatch times may vary according to availability; any guarantees or representations made as to
            delivery times are limited to mainland UK and subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure
            (including Acts of God, Acts of War or Acts of Terrorism) for which we will not be responsible. The supplier
            will not be responsible for such delays resulting from situations within the recipient's control, such as recipient
            not being available to accept delivery, or incorrect delivery details supplied. A delay does not include any
            alterations that are requested by the customer. </p>
        <h2 id="international">INTERNATIONAL ORDERS</h2>
        <p>The required minimum order for SUITSURMESUR to travel to your door step should be no less than 5 suits order (individual
            or group) within the European Union and 10 suits order and more either (individual or group) outside of the European
            Union. This policy applies strictly to one country respectively. </p>
        <p>SUITSURMESUR would in exceptional cases (to be defined by SUITSURMESUR & client) accept online measurements supplied
            by the client even if our conventional mode of operation is a face to face contact. However, SUITSURMESUR would
            not be liable for incorrect measurement supplied by the customer.</p>
