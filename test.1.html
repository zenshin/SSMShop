            <hr />

                prints in our fabric linings with each piece having a backstory. Our garments symbolise imagination, creativity
                and the link between different forms of art and culture.</p>

            <h4>SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE US</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>In the corporate world, a lot of people wear suits that are tailored in the same spirit, often too traditional
                yet lacking the exotic appeal, soul or character that embraces our social diversity. The concept was born
                out of the need to allow style conscious individuals the opportunity to assert their uniqueness yet creating
                high quality masterpieces that fit all body curvature and natural posture sans exception.</p>

            <h4>ARTISANAL APPROACH & NATURAL ABILITIES ARE STILL WITHIN OUR CONFINES</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>The personalised cutting of fabric, stitching, sewing and skills are all natural requisite aptitude employed
                in the creation of a Made To Measure tailored suit. These skills that were once acquired over many years
                through diligent apprenticeship are slowly falling into decline due in part to an ever-evolving industrialised
                society.</p>
            <p>Fortunately this artisanal approach and natural abilities are still within our confines, something that mass
                production settings can never emulate, whether in terms of construction, quality or character and allow each
                of our Made To Measure suit to have and benefit from a personalised unique soft touch.</p>

            <p>SUITSURMESUR® is a London | Paris Made To Measure brand created by <span id="dike">Monsieur Dike</span>

                    to bring its unique suiting philosophy to a new generation
                of well dressed masses. In a market where a suit body lining is traditionally homogenous and monopolised
                by western designs, we work hard to demonstrate to the world that African arts and prints can be put to good
                use cross culture especially in the construction of a corporate suit.</p>

                WITH ELEGANCE</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Our cosmopolitan approach gives an alternative to a rather traditional tailoring and organically draws upon mutual
                exchange of ideas especially one that transcends frontiers. In a nutshell our concept is inspired by the
                notion ‘make it unique, exotic yet significant’ using excellent fabrics and employing the artisanal craftsmanship
                of skilled tailors to produce a veritable work of art.</p>

            <h4>FOUNDER & CREATIVE DIRECTOR</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>Jean Louis O. DIKE graduated with a distinction in Commercial & International Law (Masters of Laws) Financial
                Services Law Specialist but could not resist pursuing his long time passion for quality tailored suits. He
                drew motivation from personal challenges wearing off the rack suits and consequently curated his own Custom
                Made suit label. Coming from a perspective where he had issues finding a ready to wear brand that offered
                a perfect fit sans compromise proved difficult. Problems such as suit jacket looking too wide and structured
                in the shoulder causing unnecessary strained upper arm creases due to his broad shoulders, suit jacket bunching
                in the under-collar back area, creating folds, break in the lapel, excessive pulling on button stance, causing
                wrinkled lines radiating outward when suit jacket is buttoned, suit trousers appearing too tight in the thigh,
                exorbitant alteration costs; all of which presented a real challenge for tailoring in the real world. Safe
                in the knowledge that Savile Row traditional tailored suits seemed at the time out of reach, he decided to
                find an alternative to Savile Row craftsmanship by offering a custom service that delivers good fit, great
                quality and achieves almost the similar level of precise tailoring as Savile Row Bespoke yet reasonable priced
                to reflect uniqueness.</p>
